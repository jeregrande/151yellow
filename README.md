Each person should create a branch and upload their java class files to it regularly; this will make compiling the final code later much easier.

To make a branch, first click on the branch current branch tab in the top left and select HotelCode.
Then, select the tab again and enter a name for your new branch. It should preview as a new branch being made off of the HotelCode one.
